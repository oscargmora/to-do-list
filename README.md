# to-do-list

Live Demo ---> https://oscargmora.github.io/to-do-list/

This is a functional to do list utilizing class constructors, ES6 Modules and webpack. This project taught me the importance of having a well-defined data structure before the programming starts. This was my biggest downfall when I first began this project. It became difficult to debug after trying to code using the first data structure. Once I restructured, it became much easier to figure out where the bugs were coming from.

This also taught me how to really use class constructors to their fullest. This is an amazing tool that I need to utilize in the future. Class constructors also made it easier when it was time to implement the UI, as wel as debug.
